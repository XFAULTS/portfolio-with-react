                I'm Rachit, a passionate explorer of the world 
                of computers. My journey began when I was around 
                12-13 years old, and since then, I have been fascinated
                by the endless possibilities that computers offer. It 
                all started with my introduction to the programming 
                language C, and I quickly found myself excelling in
                it.As the years went by, I expanded my horizons and
                delved into Python, which opened up a whole new 
                world of opportunities for me. With Python, I 
                explored the realms of Data Structures and Algorithms,
                honing my skills along the way.</p>

            <p className='text-xl'>In the 9th grade, I embarked on my web development journey,
                    starting with frontend development. It was an exciting time for me
                    as I learned the intricacies of creating captivating user
                    interfaces and crafting immersive web experiences.Throughout my college 
                    years, my passion for backend development took flight. I dived into JavaScript 
                    and embraced various backend technologies such as Node.js and Django.
                    Additionally, I ventured into the world of databases, mastering CRED 
                    (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with MongoDB and MySQL.</p>

            <p className='text-xl'>Driven by self-motivation and a thirst for knowledge 
            in the field of computer science, I am constantly seeking new challenges and
             learning opportunities. My ability to quickly grasp new concepts and technologies
              has allowed me to stay ahead of the curve.Beyond my technical skills, I possess decent
               public speaking abilities and have a knack for presenting my ideas effectively.
                This combination of technical expertise and strong communication skills enables me to deliver 
            innovative solutions and effectively collaborate with others in the realm of computer science.
